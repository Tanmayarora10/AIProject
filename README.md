Plant Disease Detection is one of the mind-boggling issues when we talk about using Technology in Agriculture. Although researches have been done to detect whether a plant is healthy or diseased using Deep Learning and with the help of Neural Network, new techniques are still being discovered.
Deep neural networks have recently been successfully applied in many diverse domains as examples of end to end learning. Neural networks provide a mapping between an input—such as an image of a diseased plant—to an output—such as a crop~disease pair. The nodes in a neural network are mathematical functions that take numerical inputs from the incoming edges, and provide a numerical output as an outgoing edge. Deep neural networks are simply mapping the input layer to the output layer over a series of stacked layers of nodes.

Plants have become an important source of energy, and are a fundamental piece in the puzzle to solve the problem of global warming. There are many types of diseases which are present in plants. To detect these diseases pattern are required to recognize them. 
A common approach in this case is the use of remote sensing techniques that explore multi and hyperspectral image captures.
 The methods that adopt this approach often employ digital image processing tools to achieve their goals. There are many types of pattern recognition algorithm which gives detection of disease with accuracy.
